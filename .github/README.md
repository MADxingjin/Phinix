FAQ
===
**Why are you rewriting Phi instead of updating it?**  
Due to the way the codebase was laid out, we decided it was easier to start from scratch rather than try to add our own features and fixes in

**What stage is Phinix currently in?**  
We are laying out the foundation of Phinix and planning out how to build upon it

**How long until there is a functional alpha?**  
Currently we do not have an ETA, we will update this when we have more of an idea
