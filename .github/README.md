3. Download and install [HugsLib](https://github.com/UnlimitedHugs/RimworldHugsLib/releases)
4. Load **HugsLib first**, *then* Phinix
5. Restart your game and you should be good to go
## Server

# FAQ
**Why are you rewriting Phi instead of updating it?**  
Due to the way the codebase was laid out, we decided it was easier to start from scratch rather than try to add our own features and fixes in

**What stage is Phinix currently in?**  
We are building the foundation and core functionality of the mod

**How long until there is a functional alpha?**  
It's here!
